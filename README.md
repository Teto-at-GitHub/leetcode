# Leetcode solutions for [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode) in C#

This is my personal fork of https://github.com/neetcode-gh/leetcode : I am mostly adding C# solutions.

### Naming convention

For each exercise in https://neetcode.io/ we add :
- a folder in `csharp/<exercise_group>/main`
- a .cs file in `csharp/<exercise_group>/testCases`

The name of the folder/files is `N<i>-L<j>-<name>`, where :
- `<i>` is the position of the exercise in https://neetcode.io/
- `<j>` is the number of the same exercise in LeetCode
- `<name>` is the name of the problem on neetCode within its group
